## The layers dialog

**View**: Hi **Controller**, The user just asked to access our system! Get his login data there.

**Controller**: OK. I'll send you the answer. Hey **Model**, my bro, take this login data and check if it's right

**Model**: The data is valid. Sending the login response.

**Controller**: OK. **View**, the user entered the correct data. I will send you his data and you load the profile page.

**View**: Thanks, **Controller**. Displaying for the user.


## Short Code Rules

### Less is more

The code should be short, clean and reusable, don't write the same on everywhere, write once and call it.

### Create Descriptive Names 

Don't call your vars/functions as VARIABLE1, ABC, or something like that. Call it as DBINSTANCE, CREDS... Need help with naming? Just follow python naming conventions!
